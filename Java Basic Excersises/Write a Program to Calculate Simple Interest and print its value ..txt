/*Write a Program to Calculate Simple Interest and print its value .


 *Task performed in this code :-

 1. Take the Initial value of Principle from the User.
 2. After that take the value of Annual Rate of Interest.
 3. Divide Annual Rate of Interest by 100.
 3. After that take the value of Time from User.

 Logic Used :-

 1. Value of Initial Value of Principal is denoted by "P".
 2. Value of Annual Rate of Interest is denoted by "R".
 3. Value of Time is denoted by "T".
 4. S.I.=(P*R*T)/100*/
